# voxform - explorations into self-supervised learning, audio models, and generation
**step 1. explore embedding models for musical instruments/audio with VAE, MAE, contrastive learning**
  - in progress!
  - dataset: NSynth from Google Magenta (need to clear SSD to download, 70something GB)
  - First architecture to explore: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

step 2. instrument classifier! for fun. 
  - add an MLP head or two after the trained encoder to classify musical instruments

step 3. synthesizer parameter estimation and patch generation (?)
  - complicated stuff, read more later
